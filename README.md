## 🎮 About the Game

AstroGlade is an intense space shooter where you pilot a spaceship through waves of enemies, collecting power-ups and battling challenging bosses. The game showcases modern C++ game development practices with a clean, modular architecture separating the engine from game logic.

### 🌟 Key Features

- **Fast-paced space combat** with smooth controls and responsive gameplay
- **Multiple enemy types** including Vanguards, Twin Blades, UFOs, Hexagons, and epic Bosses
- **Weapon system** with upgradeable shooters (Laser, Three-way, Frontal Wiper)
- **Power-up system** with health packs, weapon upgrades, and extra lives
- **Stage-based progression** with increasing difficulty
- **Visual effects** including explosions, particles, and dynamic backgrounds
- **HUD system** with health bars, score tracking, and life counters
- **Physics-based gameplay** using Box2D for collision detection and movement

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project is divided into two main components:

### AstroGladeEngine 🔧
A reusable 2D game engine providing core functionality:
- **Application Framework** - Window management, main game loop, event handling
- **World/Actor System** - Scene management and game object hierarchy  
- **Physics Integration** - Box2D integration with collision handling
- **Asset Management** - Texture and font loading with automatic cleanup
- **Widget System** - UI components (buttons, text, gauges, images)
- **Timer Management** - Scheduling system for delayed actions
- **VFX System** - Particle effects and visual enhancements
- **Game Stage System** - Level progression and game state management

### AstroGlade Game 🎯
Game-specific implementation using the engine:
- **Spaceship Hierarchy** - Player and enemy ship implementations
- **Weapon System** - Multiple weapon types with upgrade mechanics
- **Enemy AI** - Various enemy behaviors and attack patterns
- **Level Design** - Main menu, gameplay levels, and boss stages
- **HUD Implementation** - Game UI with health, score, and controls
- **Player Management** - Lives, scoring, and progression systems

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **SFML 2.6.1** - Graphics, audio, input, and window management
- **Box2D 2.4.1** - 2D physics simulation
- **CMake 3.27.7+** - Build system
- **Visual Studio 2022** - C++ compiler (Windows)
- **C++14 Standard** - Modern C++ features

### Design Patterns
- **Entity-Component System** - Flexible game object architecture
- **Template Programming** - Type-safe generic containers and smart pointers
- **Resource Management** - RAII principles with smart pointers
- **Observer Pattern** - Delegates for event handling
- **Factory Pattern** - Dynamic object creation for enemies and rewards
- **State Machine** - Game stage management and progression

## 🚀 Building the Project

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11
- Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools
- CMake 4.x
- Git

### Build Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
